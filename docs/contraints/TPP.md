# Transformation Priority Premise

## Score
Add points for each occurence in the produced code

1. constant : a value
2. scalar : a local binding, or variable
3. invocation : calling a dependency function/method
4. conditional : if/switch/case/cond
5. recursion
6. while loop : applies to for loops as well
7. assignment : replacing the value of a variable
