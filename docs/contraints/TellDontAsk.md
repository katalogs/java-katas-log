# Tell! Don't ask!

> **Tell-Don't-Ask** is a principle that helps people remember that object-orientation is about bundling data with the functions that operate on that data. It reminds us that rather than asking an object for data and acting on that data, we should instead tell an object what to do. **This encourages to move behavior into an object** to go with the data.

## [The Rules](https://kata-log.rocks/tell-dont-ask)
- No return values
- No side effects changing “global variables”
- Don’t use exceptions as return values
