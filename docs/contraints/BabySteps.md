# Baby Steps

## [The Rules](https://kata-log.rocks/baby-steps)

- Setup a git repository (or use another SCM that supports resets)
- Setup a timer for 2 minutes interval when you start
- Write exactly one test
  - If the timer rings and the test is red then revert and start over
  - If you finish your test earlier: no problem, reset the timer and continue
- Restart timer
- Go to 3.

## Hints
- Most pairs need to reset at least once
- It is absolutely OK to spend iterations to do only refactorings
- Feel free to discuss whatever is needed in between cycles
- The most important part is to have green tests. Your code base must never be red for more than two minutes
